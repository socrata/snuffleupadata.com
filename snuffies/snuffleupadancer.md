Every year, Socrata throws a big holiday bash to celebrate the year and welcome the next. While in the past, we've had a theme for our parties, this year the party was all about dressing to impress and having a classy evening. Snu, of course, was there showing off the best looks: Dapper Snu, Stay Classy Snu, Diva Snu, and Snuffleupadancer.
