We were involved in the [NASA Space Apps Challenge](https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/), a 3 day hackathon which challenged participants to develop mobile apps, software, hardware, data visualization and platform solutions that could contribute to space exploration missions and help improve life on Earth. NASA Snuffy was created in honor of this event. To read more about it, visit <http://www.socrata.com/blog/build-future-hack-universe/>
