Captain Snu was front and center at Socrata's 2017 Employee Summit. Always ready for long days at sea, Captain Snu helmed the ship for the three day gathering of all of Socrata's employees. It was here that employees learned more about the future of the company and the direction it's taking, celebrated their fellow Socratizens who received one of four of Socrata's employee awards, and learned more about each other.
